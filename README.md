# Telecom Customer Retention Dashboard

## Project Overview
This Power BI project was developed for a telecom company to analyze customer retention and predict potential churn. The goal is to provide management with actionable insights into customer behavior, identify at-risk customers, and develop strategies to proactively retain them before contract termination.

## Background
-  Customer retention is crucial : Telecom customers are valuable and hard-earned, so preventing churn is a top priority.
-  Proactive engagement : Currently, the retention department reacts only after customers terminate their contracts. The goal is to predict churn in advance and engage customers before termination.
-  Excel challenges : Previous efforts using Excel for customer analysis proved ineffective and cumbersome.
-  Clear visualization : The Retention Manager emphasized the need for a self-explanatory dashboard that could easily communicate customer insights to upper management.

## Key Features
The dashboard provides a detailed view of:
-  Churn Risk Analysis : Identifies customers most likely to churn based on historical data and behavioral patterns.
-  Retention Rates : Displays the overall retention rate and tracks changes over time.
-  At-Risk Customers : Highlights customers at risk of termination, allowing for proactive engagement.
-  Customer Segmentation : Breaks down customer groups based on different attributes such as contract length, service usage, and more.

## Advanced Features
This project incorporates the following advanced Power BI functionalities:
-  Data Modeling : Integrated multiple data sources into a unified model for a comprehensive retention analysis.
-  DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) : Used for calculating custom metrics such as churn probability, retention rates, and segmentation.
-  Interactive Visuals : Allows users to filter and drill down into specific customer segments to gain deeper insights.
-  Predictive Analysis : Leveraged historical data to predict which customers are most likely to churn.

## Data Sources
-  Customer Records : Contains information about customer contracts, service usage, and termination.
-  Retention Department Data : Data about customer engagement and efforts to win back terminated customers.
-  Churn Risk Metrics : Historical data used for identifying churn patterns and calculating risk.

## Technology Stack
-  Power BI Desktop : For data visualization and dashboard creation.
-  DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) : For custom calculations and KPIs.
-  Excel : Used for initial data exploration before importing into Power BI.

## Results and Impact
- Provided the retention department with actionable insights to proactively engage with customers at risk of churn.
- Improved customer retention strategies by identifying key at-risk segments.
- Helped management make data-driven decisions with easy-to-understand visuals and predictive analysis.
